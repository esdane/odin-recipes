       <p>It takes less than 5 minutes to make and you can tell it's tasty and yummy.</p>

       <h2>Ingredients</h2>
       <ul>
           <li>4 slices of bread</li>
           <li>4 slices of cheese (Relax! Cheese slices aren't as big as bread slices)</li>
           <li>Butter</li>
           <li>2 eggs</li>
           <li>Chilli powder</li>
           <li>Salt</li>
       </ul>
       <h2>Steps</h2>
       <ol>
            <li>Unleash the content in the eggs into a small bowl. Scramble.</li>
            <li>Add as much pepper and as much salt as you want. I would recommend just sprinkling.</li>
            <li>Put 2 slices of cheese inside 2 slices of bread, spread the egg in between the bread and in between the cheese.</li>
            <li>Repeat step 3 above for the other 2 slices of bread and cheese.</li>
            <li>Turn on your stove (low heat), put your frying pan on it, and put one teaspoon of butter in the pan.</li>
            <li>Once the butter melts, place the 2 pairs gotten from 3 and 4 into the pan. Cover and leave for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Open the pan and flip it's contents for the other side to brown. Leave for 40 seconds.</li>
            <li>Serve this wonder in a dish and and extract that juice you've been hiding in the fridge to wash it down.</li>
            <li>Don't worry about thanking me. I know you're grateful.</li>
